# Governance Game

![A picture of the cards in the game on a table](/images/cards-640px.jpg)

This is an interactive game on governance of [Public Code](https://about.publiccode.net/glossary/public-code-definition.html). Use this as a way to get a conversation and reflection about governance started. We aim to use it during [early incubation of a codebase](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/codebase-stewardship/product-assets-for-early-incubation.html), or perhaps even earlier. You can of course play the game totally without our involvement, it is probably useful for any constellation that have a codebase to govern.

## Playing the game
You need a few people to play with you. There are no strict number, but you all need to be able to see and reach the cards on the table. For the actual rules, see the rules cards.

## Roadmap

1. Finalize first design with Noun project icons and do a print.
2. Test the game with real users and collect feedback.
3. Iterate on the cards and rules. Create custom icons/imagery?
4. Do a second small scale print run.
5. More testing, tuning and preparation for next print run.
